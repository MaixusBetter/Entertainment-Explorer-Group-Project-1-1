## Description
The 2 Server-sides apis used were TMDB for suggestions and OMDB for search.

## Usage
The user can search for movies and add them to a media board. When they enter a movie name and click on search, it will display a modal with the movie's name, plot, and poster. The user will also have the option to add the movie to a watchlist. If they need movie suggestions, they can click on genre suggestions, which will provide a random movie from that genre along with the option to add it to the watchlist. Inside the watchlist, users can keep their information saved on their local computer.
